# Projects-Portfolio
Here is my budding portfolio
Currently there are 2 Projects:
1. XYZ Cafe Project (Spring 2022)
2. Saratoga Home Prices Project (Fall 2021)

Within each is a reflection on each project, including a brief summary of the project, and a post project debrief.
Each project includes the respective Technical report, and Power point of the project.
The XYZ Cafe Project also contains an excel document of the consolidated data observation and research throughout the project. The code that was a major part of this project has been excluded as it was written by a team member, and indicative of my own skills.

EDIT: 4/20/2023
Project 3 added, Waste Data ANOVA Project, reflection in progress.
