# Projects-Portfolio
Hi there, my name is Troy Rodriguez. I graduated May 2023 from Metro State Univerisity with a B.S. in Industrial and Applied Math and minor in Applied Statistics. 

I'm fully invested in continuous learning and doing my best. Here you'll find a reflection and the associated files for some of the projects I've worked on.
