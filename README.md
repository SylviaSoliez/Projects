# Projects-Portfolio
Hi there, my name is Troy Rodriguez. I graduated May 2023 from Metro State Univerisity with a B.S. in Industrial and Applied Math and minor in Applied Statistics. 

I'm fully invested in continuous learning and doing my best. I've mostly worked with R and JMP, but can easily learn new languages now that I have plenty of experience thanks to my projects. I've also had experience with Python early on, and found it very intuitive. Since graduation, I've taken online courses on SQL, and Access.

Here you'll find a reflection and the associated files for some of the projects I've worked on. 

Thanks for viewing my Project Portfolio! Please reach out on LinkedIn for any inquiries. ðŸ˜„
