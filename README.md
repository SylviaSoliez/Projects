# Projects-Portfolio
Here is my portfolio, I'll intend to keep my works here for preservation and as a reminder of how much I've grown.

Currently there are 4 Projects:
1. XYZ Cafe Project (Spring 2022)
2. Saratoga Home Prices Project (Fall 2021)
3. Waste Data ANOVA Project (Spring 2023)
4. Industry Client Project (Spring 2023)

Within each is a reflection on each project, including a brief summary of the project, and a post project debrief.
