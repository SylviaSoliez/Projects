# Projects-Portfolio
Hi there, my name is Sylvia Rodriguez. I graduated May 2023 from Metro State Univerisity with a B.S. in Industrial and Applied Math and minor in Applied Statistics. 

Here you'll find a reflection and the associated files for some of the projects I've worked on. 
I hope you find these projects interesting. I've mostly worked with R and JMP, but can easily learn new languages.
