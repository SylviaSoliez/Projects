# Projects-Portfolio
Hi there, my name is Sylvia Soliez. I graduated May 2023 from Metro State Univerisity with a B.S. in Industrial and Applied Math and minor in Applied Statistics. 

Here you'll find various projects I've worked on. 
I've mostly worked with R, Excel and JMP, but have experience with Python, SQL, and Power BI.
